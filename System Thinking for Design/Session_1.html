                <h3><strong>Recap</strong></h3>
                <p>Design Thinking is a human-centred approach to innovation that
                    draws from the designer’s
                    toolkit to integrate the needs of people, the possibilities of 
                    technology, and 
                    the requirements for business success </p>
                <p>Design Thinking is a strategy for creative problem solving by 
                    prioritising customers’requirements above everything else.
                    It helps to engage a person in several opportunities
                    like experimenting and creating a prototype model, gathering feedback
                    from customersand redesigning the product using innovative solutions.
                    You can apply design thinking
                    to various fields such as architecture, engineering, business, etc.  </p>
                <p>Design Thinking is a solution-based approach where you focus on 
                    finding solutionsto the problems in contrast to the problem-based
                    approach. The problem-based thinking approach focuses on 
                    finding obstacles and limitations on why a problem exists. </p>
